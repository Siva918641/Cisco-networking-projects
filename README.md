# Cisco Networking Projects

This repository contains a collection of networking labs and configurations created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
Each project focuses on different networking concepts such as **LAN**, **VLAN**, **Routing Protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP)**, **ACLs**, **DHCP**, **SSH**, **VoIP**, and more.

These labs were built to support my learning and practice in **network engineering** and **cybersecurity**.

## Lab Categories

- **Single & Dual LAN** – Basic network setup using static IPs and router-based interconnection.  
- **VLAN & DHCP** – Network segmentation with dynamic IP address assignment.  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – Traffic filtering and access restrictions.  
- **Routing Protocols**:
  - RIP (Routing Information Protocol)  
  - OSPF (Single Area and Multi-Area)  
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)  
- **SSH** – Secure remote device management via CLI.  
- **VoIP** – Voice over IP telephony setup with DHCP and telephony services.  
- **Static IP** – Manual IP addressing for network devices.  
- **HTTP Server** – Hosting and accessing a basic HTTP service within the network.

##  How to Use

1. Download the `.pkt` files from any lab folder.  
2. Open them using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
3. Review the `.txt` file for configuration commands.  
4. Check the `.png` screenshots for expected outputs.  
5. Modify and experiment with the labs to strengthen your understanding.
