# Cisco Networking Projects

This repository contains a collection of networking labs and configurations created using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each project focuses on different networking concepts such as LAN, VLAN, Routing Protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP), ACLs, DHCP, and more.

These labs were built to support my learning and practice in the areas of network engineering and cybersecurity.

## Lab Categories

- Single & Dual LAN – Basic network setup using static IPs and router-based interconnection
- VLAN & DHCP – Network segmentation and dynamic IP address assignment
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) – Traffic filtering and access restrictions
- Routing Protocols:
  - RIP
  - OSPF (Single Area and Multi-Area)
  - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

## What You’ll Learn

- Configuring network devices using the CLI
- Static and dynamic routing
- Layer 2 and Layer 3 networking concepts
- Building and testing real-world topologies
- Analyzing packet flow and connectivity

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Basic CLI configuration

## How to Use

1. Download the `.pkt` files from any lab folder.
2. Open them using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Use the `.txt` files to view or apply configuration commands.
4. Modify and test the labs to reinforce your understanding.
