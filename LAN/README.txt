Single & Dual LAN Network Topologies

Description:
This lab demonstrates two foundational LAN setups using Cisco Packet Tracer:

A Single LAN setup where multiple devices communicate within one subnet.

A Dual LAN setup where two separate LANs are connected via a router to enable inter-network communication.

Both topologies are included in the same .pkt file, organized separately for clarity.

Tools & Technologies:
Cisco Packet Tracer

Switches

PCs

Router (for dual LAN)

Static IP addressing

Static Routing (for dual LAN)

Key Objectives:
(i) Single LAN:
Learn basic LAN setup

Configure static IPs on end devices

Establish communication using a single switch

(ii)Dual LAN with Router:
Connect two LANs with different subnets via a router

Configure static routing on the router

Enable end-to-end communication between both networks

Tasks Performed:
Assigned static IP addresses to all hosts

Connected devices to switches and router accordingly

Configured router interfaces and static routes

Verified connectivity using ping across same and different networks

Files Included:
Single-Dual-LAN.pkt — Packet Tracer topology containing both setups

Router_Config.txt — Router CLI configuration for dual LAN


Learning Outcomes:
Understood the basics of Layer 2 switching and Layer 3 routing

Practiced IP addressing and troubleshooting connectivity

Learned how static routing enables communication across different networks
